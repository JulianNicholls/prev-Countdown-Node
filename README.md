# Countdown Magician 3

## This is now obsolete and the latest version is here:
[Github Repo](https://github.com/JulianNicholls/Countdown-Node).

## Raw Webpack project

This is an example (perhaps, not a great one) of how to set up a Webpack project, but I would not advice that for a new React project. Use create-react-app, it's so much easier and still possible to escape from if you need more control.

I have never needed to eject a CRA project, so YMMV :-)

## Description

This is a rewrite in Node / React of my Ruby Countdown Magician, which runs
[here](http://immense-countdown.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. More information here
[Github Repo](https://github.com/JulianNicholls/Countdown)

This version runs [here](https://reallybigshoe.co.uk/countdown/index.html).

## To run when developing

run `npm run dev-standalone` in the main directory.

### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for more than 10 years. Over that time, I have
tried many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one that was
easier and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent Git
shell that runs on PC, Mac, and Unix. I would encourage everyone to use it.
