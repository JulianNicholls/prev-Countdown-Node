# Countdown Magician 2

This is a rewrite in Node / React of my Ruby Countdown Magician, which runs
[here](http://immense-countdown.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. More information here
[Github Repo](https://github.com/JulianNicholls/Countdown)

This version runs [here](http://countdown.reallybigshoe.co.uk). 
You may need to be patient when you first use it because it runs on a free Heroku 
instance and so will take up to 30s to start.

## To run when developing

run `npm run dev` in the main directory.

### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years. Over that time, I have
tried many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one that was
easier and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent Git
shell that runs on PC, Mac, and Unix. I would encourage everyone to use it.
