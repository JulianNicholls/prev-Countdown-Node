# Countdown Magician 2

This is a rewrite in Node / React of my Ruby Countdown Magician, which runs
[here](http://immense-countdown.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. More information here

### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years. Over that time, I have
tried many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one that was
easier and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent Git
shell that runs on PC, Mac, and Unix. I would encourage everyone to use it.
